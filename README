into your posts and pages, and embed a Thingiverse Stream widget into your
sidebars.

Or, you can:

1. Clone this repository to thingiverse-embed/
2. Copy the thingiverse-embed/ directory to your Wordpress' plugins directory.
3. Activate the plugin
4. Embed some [thingiverse] shortcodes and Thingiverse Stream widgets!
